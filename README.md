# README.md vim-recipesj

This is a work in progress about an idea of creating more smart snippets for a
typical java project, I'm starting with a fuzzy search import selection, from a
predefined list of classes and static imports and FZF. Eventually I want to have
many 'recipes' that automates the import and code insertion from custom
snippets formatted files.

Currently I'm having issues when inserting multiple imports or static imports,
also I'm using a personal file with a fixed location for the imports, so that
will be the current focus.
